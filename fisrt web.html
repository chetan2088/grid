<p><b>Maharana Pratap</b> was born in a Hindu Rajput family. He was born to Udai Singh II and Jaiwanta Bai.[3][4][5] His younger brothers were <em>Shakti Singh</em>, <em>Vikram Singh</em> and <em>Jagmal Singh</em>. Pratap also had 2 stepsisters: <b>Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar</b>. He was married to Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia.[citation needed] He belonged to the Royal Family of Mewar.[6]

After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him[7] but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed.</p>
